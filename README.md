# Foxhole-Audio-Template
This is a template UE project for audio modding. 

All of the assets are reconstructed from the unpacked asset data meaning that they have the same properties as the original assets. 

Use is as simple as opening the `War.uproject`!

My suggestion to use this is to create a new project and copy only the assets that you need. In order to replicate the sound as close as possible, I highly suggest that you copy the submixes and the sound classes too.

## Commit Tags
There are 3 types of commits that will be made to inform when you might want to upgrade to the newest version of the template:
* **MAJOR**: When you absolutely MUST upgrade to the newest. This will likely be for major game updates.
* **MINOR**: When you should consider updating as there are fixes or improvements, but you don't have to.
* **PATCH**: When the change is so small that you can have a look at what changed to see if you should bother to update, but doesn't really matter if you don't want to.
* **README**: Just an update to the README.md file.
